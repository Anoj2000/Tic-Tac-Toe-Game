# Strategic Grid Tic Tac Toe Game

This is an Android application that implements the "Strategic Grid" version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is built using Kotlin and provides an engaging and strategic gameplay experience with additional features.

## Description

The "Strategic Grid" version of the Tic Tac Toe is an engaging adaptation of the age-old two-player game. The game board is a 3Ã—3 grid, and the players place their own distinctive markers, usually represented as "X" and "O," in sequence to attempt to make a row, column, or diagonal of their symbols. This game of wits was a climactic point where each move needed to be carefully monitored and outperformed by the adversary. Every alignment gets players additional points toward completing all matches that get harder to win. Yet, a wrong turn can disrupt the game and shift the dynamics of the game, forcing the players to work extra hard. The "Strategic Grid" is the perfect place to practice strategic thinking while offering a fun and enthusiastic gameplay experience.
